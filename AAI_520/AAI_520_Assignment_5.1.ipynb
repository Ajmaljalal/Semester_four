    "We are implementing and solving a complex financial problem using advanced prompt engineering techniques in Python. Our focus is on utilizing three key prompting strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting** - Step-by-step reasoning through investment calculations\n",
    "2. **Self-Consistency Chain of Thought (SC-CoT) Prompting** - Multiple reasoning paths for consistency validation\n",
    "3. **Few-Shot Prompting** - Learning from examples to predict investment outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques simulate how language models can be guided to solve complex financial problems through structured reasoning approaches.\n"

    "## Summary and Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Through implementing and executing three advanced prompt engineering techniques for financial investment calculations, we have gained valuable insights based on actual results from our $10,000 investment scenario over 5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings from Executed Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting:\n",
    "- **Actual Result**: Successfully calculated final amount of $11,600.15 from $10,000 initial investment\n",
    "- **Strength**: Provided complete transparency with year-by-year breakdown showing each calculation step\n",
    "- **Key Insight**: Demonstrated how taxes are only applied to positive gains (Year 2 showed -5% return with no tax)\n",
    "- **Practical Value**: Clear audit trail showing $1,600.15 net gain after accounting for fees ($500 total) and taxes ($463.97 total)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Self-Consistency Chain of Thought (SC-CoT) Prompting:\n",
    "- **Successful Validation**: Both methods produced consistent results, confirming calculation accuracy\n",
    "- **Method A Result**: $11,600.15 (sequential year-by-year calculation)\n",
    "- **Method B Result**: $11,600.15 (accumulative calculation with tracking)\n",
    "- **Key Insight**: **Consistency achieved** demonstrates reliable calculation methodology and builds confidence in results\n",
    "- **Learning**: Multiple reasoning paths with identical outcomes validate the robustness of our investment calculation approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Few-Shot Prompting:\n",
    "- **Actual Result**: Successfully predicted $14,708.91 for the new $12,000 investment scenario\n",
    "- **Training Process**: Learned from 3 diverse examples with different parameters and outcomes\n",
    "- **Strength**: Applied learned calculation pattern to generate detailed step-by-step reasoning for new scenario\n",
    "- **Practical Insight**: Showed $2,708.91 projected gain over 5 years with 18% tax rate and $120 annual fees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Insights from Actual Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validation Success**: SC-CoT's consistency confirms the reliability of our calculation methodology\n",
    "2. **Calculation Robustness**: The investment problem's complex interactions between returns, fees, and taxes were handled consistently across different approaches\n",
    "3. **Method Reliability**: Both sequential and accumulative calculation methods produced identical results, increasing confidence\n",
    "4. **Transparency Benefits**: Detailed logging in all methods made it easy to trace and verify each calculation step\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications:\n",
    "1. **Financial Modeling**: CoT provides auditable calculations for investment projections\n",
    "2. **Quality Assurance**: SC-CoT serves as a validation tool to confirm calculation accuracy through multiple approaches\n",
    "3. **Pattern Learning**: Few-Shot enables rapid application of financial calculation patterns to new scenarios\n",
    "4. **Risk Management**: Consistent validation approaches increase confidence in financial decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Conclusions:\n",
    "The execution results demonstrate that these prompting techniques are powerful tools for financial calculation accuracy and reliability. The SC-CoT consistency validates our methodology, while CoT provides transparency and Few-Shot enables pattern-based predictions. Together, these techniques create a robust framework for tackling complex financial problems with both accuracy and confidence."
