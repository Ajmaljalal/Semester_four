## Instructions
In this task, you will apply Natural Language Processing (NLP), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Part-of-Speech (PoS) techniques in NLP to analyze the Climate Fever dataset. The dataset contains climate change-related articles, and your task is to extract named entities and assign PoS tags to different parts of speech in the text.

## Required Technology 
Dataset: climate-fever.csv in the same directory

## Environment:
- Install the necessary libraries for NLP in Python, such as NLTK, Spacy, or any other library of your choice.
- Load the dataset into your Python environment and preprocess the data as needed (e.g., remove unnecessary characters, tokenize, etc.).

## Required Details
- Apply NER techniques to identify named entities (such as persons, organizations, locations, etc.) within the text. 
- Implement PoS tagging to ass-ign appropriate parts of speech to different words in the text. Analyze the results and provide insights on the named entities and their corresponding parts of speech in the Climate Fever dataset.
- Visualize the findings using appropriate graphs, charts, or tables to enhance understanding.
- Summarize your approach, the findings, and any challenges faced during the process.

  ## Implementation guides:
- Follow the above instructions and write the approperiate description and python code cells to implement the task. 
- Make sure to only and only do the tasks as mentioned exactactly in the instructions above and here. 
- Do not do any extra steps, code, do not write any code that is not relavent or not needed
- Use "we" instead of "I" or third person. Also use "ing" forms like building a plan instead of Build a plan for example
- Keep the cells short, do not print any unecessary lines. Also do one thing per cell
- Make sure our training is not printing th epoch process, we can just do a one print statement at the end indicating training complete.
